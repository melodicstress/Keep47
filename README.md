# Keep47

Keep47 is a PGP key manager and messaging companion app with Auth47-based SSO.  
The goal is to make it easy to manage PGP identities, import BIP47 payment codes, and interact with Auth47-capable services from a single mobile client.

## Features (planned / WIP)

- PGP keychain management (import, view keys, basic metadata)
- Auth47 SSO flows for compatible services
- BIP47-related utilities for notification/payment codes
- Simple, mobile-first UI built with Expo + React Native + TypeScript

## Tech stack

- Expo / React Native
- TypeScript
- Custom React components and contexts for keys, widgets, and navigation
